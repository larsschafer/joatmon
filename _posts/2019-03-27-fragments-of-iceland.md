title: Time to change things
excerpt: >-
  I have always been a great fan of the concept of "learn by doing", and it sure
  has given me a lot of fun, but also a lot of travelling down the dead ends.
  When it comes to the more important changes that relates to fitness, health
  and in particular weight, there has never been any shortage of ideas.

## Time for a change on all accounts.

I have wanted to start this blog for ages, but
for so many reasons I have postponed it. But lately many things kind of fell
into place, and I got the final push, when I by coincidence came across the
video **“How I became a millionaire”** with **Ali Abdaal on YouTube.** Honestly, I
never ever click on these kinds of videos but the add said it was done by
writing, and the thumbnail I had mistaken for being the famous Alex, the French
guy cooking. I love that guy. So, it was by pure chance I actually got to see
the video from Ali Abdaal, and he just hit the nail right on. It was the final
push to get this started. And what better time and better topic than exactly
changes?

8 days ago, I started a new somewhat self-made
program and facilitate positive changes in my life, and I am thrilled to see
where it will bring me. I am also positive that it will bring me somewhere
interesting and good, so for the sake of future reference I decided to share
that journey. But first a little background. Ever since I stopped training hard
in track 26 years ago, I have gained weight in a steady pace. Most of my work
is behind a computer, so I get to move less than I did as a younger person. I
work freelance, so I do have the freedom to do what I want and when I want, at
least theoretically, but exercise is not one of them, apart from the occasional
trail run.

I have tried a lot of different things like intermittent
fasten, no carb, no sugar, no alcohol, keto diet, no eating at all for 7 days,
and the list goes on. Some of it worked a few days, some a few weeks, but
nothing lasted. When I had most success, it was with the intermittent fasten,
but not even that lasted.

A couple of weeks ago I was amazed by a friend
of mine. He had done a \*\*program \*\*called \*\*75 Hard \*\*and lost 16 kg doing that. I have
known him for years, and he did need a change in his life for sure, but to see
it actually happening was impressive, so I looked at the 75 Hard program. It is
75 days where you are supposed to obey strictly by a certain set of rules, and
there are no room for exceptions. If you fail just one day to do one of the
things on the list, then you are starting over. The program is not about losing
weight, but about forcing you to change your habits, and all depending on what
you then put into that program you will get a different output.

My friend tailormade it to give a weight loss
as side effect. That program was not for me, I could tell that right from the
start. It is for people who has the need to change their life 180 degrees.
People like my friend who at the age of only 50 had retired and ended up just
eating, drinking, partying, sleeping and then some more food. Little to no
exercise and just overall a whole range of bad habits. Sure, I have my bad
habits, but in general I am quite happy with the way my life evolves. But a few
things needed tweaking, and I like the program in terms of behavior change. So,
I came up with my own solution and started that program 8 days ago.

To understand my program, and my choice of
focus, let me quickly outline my objective. I am 101.4 kg (223 lb.) heavy and I
am 185 cm (6 foot 1) tall and I have slightly elevated blood pressure. My
weight is around my waist. I got a ton of interests, hiking, camping, kayaking,
trail run, caving, photo, cooking, fishing, and I also try to get some business
going with YouTube. At the side I am also very interesting in camp cooking and
experiment with freeze drying of food. But I do have limited success, and I
came to realize that there is a fundamental reason for that. First of all, I
have allowed so much on my plate that I get stressed by the mere thought of it,
and in order to get things done efficiently, then I spend all my time PLANNING.
Once I have spent a day planning how to approach all this, I am exhausted and
need a break. Maybe I get something done, but before long I am again sitting
and planning instead of actually doing.

So, I did not need a program to help me get
active, or to find new interests, or even to teach me how to plan my day. I
needed a sustainable program that would lead to more success in terms of both
health and work. When my previous attempts have failed me, I believe it has
been because they all in their nature were temporarily solutions and/or with
too tight limitations. So, my new program, which is yet to be proven a good
one, is a combination of many things, and it has its biggest inspiration from
the **75 Hard program**. If you want to learn about that program, then head over to
**www.andyfrisella.com.** I made my program to be something that I believe can work
for life, except from one single detail, but I made it a "test" for
an initial 90 days. So here is my program, will explain the bullet points
below.

\-       Morning routine

\-       3 liter of water per day

\-       Intermitted fasten 9 hours

\-       1 hour exercise minimum per day

\-       15 minutes strength training per day

\-       NO SUGAR

\-       Alcohol max 1 times a month

\-       Carbs max 1 times a week    

So, to begin with the first one. A good
beginning is paramount to everything we do in life,may that be daily, weekly monthly
or even yearly, and each day is a new beginning, so by creating a certain set
of easy rules from the very start, brings you a positive vibe right away.
Shower, shave, makeup, dress well, it can be whatever, that gives a change, and
has positive impact. Could even just being standing in front of the mirror and quote
a positive mantra for the day.

3 liter of water is a tough one for me. The 75
hard says 4 liters, but I have never been good at drinking water. 1/2-1 liter a
day, and if it was a hard day maybe up to 2 liters. This is also a reason this
particular bullet point is so good for me, now I raise my water intake to a
healthy level. But trust me, I do have 2 days in my program already, where I
only managed drinking 2,5 liter of water. This "bump" on the road had
me adjusting that bullet point, so now it is "as much as I can, and
nothing but water until I pass 3 liter". No reason to drown myself for a principle.

Intermitted fasten. I have done it so many
times before, always at a 8 hour schedule, and it works pretty alright. But 8
hours require some more planning than I like in my regular life, so I changed
it in this program to 9 hours. Remember, I aim to make a program that will work
for life, without too much pain, but still yield the results.

1 hour exercise minimum. Never really thought
that would be a problem, but now when it is a fact of the program, I am aware
of how often I skip it in favor of other things like work. Seems logic and
reasonable, work is important. But a healthy body host a healthy mind, so not
really. Work is important, but so is keeping fit. There have been days where I
had to drag my butt out running at 9 pm, because I forgot. But note, I have
made the obligation easier by not stating WHAT I need to do. This is also an
adjustment from earlier programs, where I dictated X number of km running or
cycling. It was too easy to fail, too hard to succeed.

15 minutes of strength training per day is
simple just to keep tighten your body up. Doing some pushups, sit-ups and a few
exercises for your back. I spend 3 years in the army, pushups are second nature
to me. Or, it was. I just realized that I am not able to do one single pushup
as I started this program, so that is an objective in itself. I want to be able
to do it.

No sugar goes without saying, but this has also
been a subject for failure in the past, so this is with modification. I love chocolate,
wine gums, coca cola and cakes. Let that be said, I really love it, but I can
stay away from it without much trouble. But one thing I just cannot live
without, and it is the reason for all previous failures, it is my sacred hot
mocha in a cafe every single day, if I am in urban areas. Mocha is a
combination of espresso and hot chocolate. BIG no in all programs you might
find, but again, this is not an extreme, get fit in 7 days program. It is an
adjustment for life. This is however also the only bullet point that only
stands for the 90 days. This is to force myself away from it, and after the 90
days I can do what I want, and probably do not want it anyway.

Alcohol once a month. This is simple to have a
rule. I do not like beer or alcohol for that matter, but I do like the buzz
they give, so I drink 1-2 times a month as it is without rules. I could go a
full year without if needed, but again, this is for life, not to prove
anything.

Carbs once a week. This is obviously part of my
attempt to reach 90 kg. But experience for me says, that if I ban myself
totally from carbs, bread, pasta, potato, rice, then I go nuts. Given that I
also program myself to 1+ hour training a day, then carbs is not a bad thing, I
just choose to speed up the weight loss with this little addition.

So, how am I doing after 8 days? I am doing
just perfect. Day 1 I was at 101.4 kg and day 7 I was at 99 kg. I already feel
better and my blood pressure has already gone down to normal. I am sure the
water has a lot to do with that. I step on the scale every 7 days, so I am excited
to see how this program goes. I have also started this blog on day 8, my YouTube
channel got boosted and crossed 1000 subs yesterday, and I have made new
improvements for the videos I make. Forcing myself to plan less and to do more
has already proven very productive.
